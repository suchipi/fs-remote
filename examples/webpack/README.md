This example uses `fs-server` with webpack, aliasing `fs` in the webpack config, so that clientside code can transparently require `fs` and get a working `fs` module.

### Instructions

* Run `yarn install`
* Run `yarn server` in one terminal
* Run `yarn client` in another terminal
* Open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser.
